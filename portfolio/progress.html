		<h3 class="flow1title">Flow 1</h3>
		<p>Flow 1 was the beginning of this education. I had no prior experience with Photoshop, and that was the program we had to work with mostly. I spent a lot of time editing objects out of the image, and learning how to mix two images together.The final assignment for flow 1 was "Dream your portfolio" which was made in Adobe XD, and i have posted my end result in the "Work" page.</p>

		<div class="flow2">
		<h3 class="flow2title">Flow 2</h3>
			<p>In flow 2 we began looking into coding. Like photoshop, i had no experience with this, but this came to me more naturally than the design and editing work, because unlike designing, there is "correct" and "incorrect". I have something to work towards, i don't have to come up with something completely new. For the final assignment, i coded my page to look exactly like my"Dream your portfolio" prototype.</p>

			<h3 class="flow3title">Flow 3</h3>
			<p>In flow 3 we started working with Adobe Illustrator, making icons, drawing things, learning about colors, and more technical things, as creating personas, idea and concept development, datacollection and so on. The final project for this flow was "Build an app" where i chose to make a weather app, making icons and illustrations in illutrator, and then transfering it to Adobe XD.</p>

		<div class="flow4">
		<h3 class="flow4title">Flow 4</h3>
			<p>Flow 4 started out with more technical knowledge. How to use and make a styleguide, visual identity, information architecture and project planning.
			The flow ended with a group project, where we needed to code a website called "Sweetbot" and how to work with a premade styleguide. It was a difficult project, as it was my first assignment, where we were multiple people. The coordination and planning needed to make that work really taught me a lot.</p>
