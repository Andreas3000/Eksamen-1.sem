			<p>My name is Andreas Otto Brage. I am 25 years old, i live in Elsinore, Denmark,  and i am a Multimedia designer in the making. I have a great hunger for knowledge, and always want to learn more, become better and do my best to challenge myself. I have no prior experience with anything design wise, and my learning curve has been steep. I enjoy the simple, but impressive sites, and i like working with the darker colors when designing. That is what i have tried to do with this page, and even though i know that there is room for improvement, i know that i my learning curve will stay steep.</p>
